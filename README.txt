Voting Board
A fun voting app by Tom Morreale


Fun site I threw together in a couple hours based off previous examples. First dive into a Meteor application for other people. Doesn't work well on mobile yet.

I originally built this so a bunch of my swimmer friends could vote on who gots the best grades for a quarter, but I have since removed their names and pictures. Though that can easily be substitued with anything. Fun voting site.
