Voting Board
A fun voting app by Tom Morreale


Fun site I threw together in a couple hours based off previous examples. First dive into a Meteor application for other people. Doesn't work well on mobile yet.

I originally built this so a bunch of my friends could vote on each for various competitions (best test score, etc.), but I have since removed their names and pictures. Though that can easily be substitued with anything. Fun voting site.
